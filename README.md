# Ch_4_Challenge_1

This application is a jupyter lab notebook application that evaluates four investment portfolios. It works by taking the data located in the whale_navs cvs file and puts it through various financial algorithms such as: percent change, cumprod (figues out the cumulative returns), std (figures out the standard deviation), annualized standard deviation, rolling standard deviation, annualized average return, sharpe ratio, and beta. Then it plots the result to get a better understanding of the four portfolios compared between each other and the market. This helps us give a better opinion on which one to invest in.
